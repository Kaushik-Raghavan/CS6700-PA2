# Programming Assignment 3

### Run
* It is recommended to use python version >= 3.5
* In the command line, after moving to the required directory where run.py file is present, type `python3 run.py`
* For each question, the learning methods are implemented in algorithms.py file which is imported in run.py file and used for demonstrations.
* For Q1, if you want to change the goal, either make the necessary changes in plan1.txt or load different plan files in the puddleworld environment code

### Structure
* Each question file Q1 and Q2 contains the two files run.py and algorithms.py.
* run.py contains the code that performs the experiment
* algorithms.py contains the implementation of the algorithms (Q-learning and SARSA for Q1, Policy gradient method for Q2)
